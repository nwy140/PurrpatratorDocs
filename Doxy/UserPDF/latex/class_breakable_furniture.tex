Called by PUN several times per second, so that your script can write and read synchronization data for the Photon\+View. 

This method will be called in scripts that are assigned as Observed component of a Photon\+View.~\newline
 Photon\+Network.\+Serialization\+Rate affects how often this method is called.~\newline
 Photon\+Network.\+Send\+Rate affects how often packages are sent by this client.~\newline


Implementing this method, you can customize which data a Photon\+View regularly synchronizes. Your code defines what is being sent (content) and how your data is used by receiving clients.

Unlike other callbacks, {\itshape On\+Photon\+Serialize\+View only gets called when it is assigned to a Photon\+View} as Photon\+View.\+observed script.

To make use of this method, the Photon\+Stream is essential. It will be in \char`\"{}writing\char`\"{} mode\char`\"{} on the client that controls a Photon\+View (\+Photon\+Stream.\+Is\+Writing == true) and in \char`\"{}reading mode\char`\"{} on the remote clients that just receive that the controlling client sends.  \+If you skip writing any value into the stream, PUN will skip the update. Used carefully, this can conserve bandwidth and messages (which have a limit per room/second).  \+Note that On\+Photon\+Serialize\+View is not called on remote clients when the sender does not send any update. This can\textquotesingle{}t be used as \char`\"{}x-\/times per second Update()"{}.
