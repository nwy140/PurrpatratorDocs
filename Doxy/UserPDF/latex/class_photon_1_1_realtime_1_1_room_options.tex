The room\textquotesingle{}s custom properties to set. 

Use string keys!

Custom room properties are any key-\/values you need to define the game\textquotesingle{}s setup. The shorter your keys are, the better. Example\+: Map, Mode (could be \char`\"{}m\char`\"{} when used with \char`\"{}\+Map\char`\"{}), Tile\+Set (could be \char`\"{}t\char`\"{}).

{\footnotesize\ttfamily string [$\,$] Photon.\+Realtime.\+Room\+Options.\+Custom\+Room\+Properties\+For\+Lobby = new string[0]}



Defines the custom room properties that get listed in the lobby. 

Name the custom room properties that should be available to clients that are in a lobby. Use with care. Unless a custom property is essential for matchmaking or user info, it should not be sent to the lobby, which causes traffic and delays for clients in the lobby.

Default\+: No custom properties are sent to the lobby.

Informs the server of the expected plugin setup. 

The operation will fail in case of a plugin missmatch returning error code Plugin\+Mismatch 32757(0x7\+FFF -\/ 10). Setting string[]\{\} means the client expects no plugin to be setup. Note\+: for backwards compatibility null omits any check.

By default, property changes are sent back to the client that\textquotesingle{}s setting them to avoid de-\/sync when properties are set concurrently. 

This option is enables by default to fix this scenario\+:

1) On server, room property ABC is set to value FOO, which triggers notifications to all the clients telling them that the property changed. 2) While that notification is in flight, a client sets the ABC property to value BAR. 3) Client receives notification from the server and changes it{\ucr}s local copy of ABC to FOO. 4) Server receives the set operation and changes the official value of ABC to BAR, but never notifies the client that sent the set operation that the value is now BAR.

Without this option, the client that set the value to BAR never hears from the server that the official copy has been updated to BAR, and thus gets stuck with a value of FOO.

\doxysubsubsection{CleanupCacheOnLeave}
{\footnotesize\ttfamily bool Photon.\+Realtime.\+Room\+Options.\+Cleanup\+Cache\+On\+Leave\hspace{0.3cm}{\ttfamily [get]}, {\ttfamily [set]}}



Removes a user\textquotesingle{}s events and properties from the room when a user leaves. 

This makes sense when in rooms where players can\textquotesingle{}t place items in the room and just vanish entirely. When you disable this, the event history can become too long to load if the room stays in use indefinitely. Default\+: true. Cleans up the cache and props of leaving users.

\doxysubsubsection{DeleteNullProperties}
{\footnotesize\ttfamily bool Photon.\+Realtime.\+Room\+Options.\+Delete\+Null\+Properties\hspace{0.3cm}{\ttfamily [get]}, {\ttfamily [set]}}



Optionally, properties get deleted, when null gets assigned as value. 

Defaults to off / false.

When Op Set\+Properties is setting a key\textquotesingle{}s value to null, the server and clients should remove the key/value from the Custom Properties. By default, the server keeps the keys (and null values) and sends them to joining players.

Important\+: Only when Set\+Properties does a \char`\"{}broadcast\char`\"{}, the change (key, value = null) is sent to clients to update accordingly. This applies to Custom Properties for rooms and actors/players.

\doxysubsubsection{IsOpen}
{\footnotesize\ttfamily bool Photon.\+Realtime.\+Room\+Options.\+Is\+Open\hspace{0.3cm}{\ttfamily [get]}, {\ttfamily [set]}}



Defines if this room can be joined at all. 

If a room is closed, no player can join this. As example this makes sense when 3 of 4 possible players start their gameplay early and don\textquotesingle{}t want anyone to join during the game. The room can still be listed in the lobby (set is\+Visible to control lobby-\/visibility).

\doxysubsubsection{IsVisible}
{\footnotesize\ttfamily bool Photon.\+Realtime.\+Room\+Options.\+Is\+Visible\hspace{0.3cm}{\ttfamily [get]}, {\ttfamily [set]}}



Defines if this room is listed in the lobby. 

If not, it also is not joined randomly.

A room that is not visible will be excluded from the room lists that are sent to the clients in lobbies. An invisible room can be joined by name but is excluded from random matchmaking.

Use this to \char`\"{}hide\char`\"{} a room and simulate \char`\"{}private rooms\char`\"{}. Players can exchange a roomname and create it invisble to avoid anyone else joining it.

\doxysubsubsection{PublishUserId}
{\footnotesize\ttfamily bool Photon.\+Realtime.\+Room\+Options.\+Publish\+User\+Id\hspace{0.3cm}{\ttfamily [get]}, {\ttfamily [set]}}



Defines if the User\+Ids of players get \char`\"{}published\char`\"{} in the room. 

Useful for Find\+Friends, if players want to play another game together. 

When you set this to true, \doxyref{Photon}{p.}{namespace_photon} will publish the User\+Ids of the players in that room. In that case, you can use Photon\+Player.\+user\+Id, to access any player\textquotesingle{}s user\+ID. This is useful for Find\+Friends and to set \char`\"{}expected users\char`\"{} to reserve slots in a room.

{\footnotesize\ttfamily bool Photon.\+Realtime.\+Room\+Options.\+Suppress\+Room\+Events\hspace{0.3cm}{\ttfamily [get]}, {\ttfamily [set]}}



Tells the server to skip room events for joining and leaving players. 

Using this makes the client unaware of the other players in a room. That can save some traffic if you have some server logic that updates players but it can also limit the client\textquotesingle{}s usability.
