If you have any questions contact me on {\texttt{ johan.\+holtby@gmail.\+com}}

I also will put up video tutorials on my youtube\+: {\texttt{ http\+://www.\+youtube.\+com/user/\+Norritt42/videos}}

This is a doxygen tool for Unity. It only works for Windows since it uses external batch files. I have been inspired by {\texttt{ http\+://www.\+jacobpennock.\+com/\+Blog/?p=629}}

{\bfseries{To use this tool you need to install\+:}} 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Doxygen -\/ www.\+doxygen.\+org 
\item A La\+TeX to pdf tool -\/ e.\+g. {\texttt{ http\+://miktex.\+org/download}}  
\item Remember to update miketex using Update(admin))  
\item Install Ghostscript if needed -\/ {\texttt{ http\+://www.\+ghostscript.\+com/download/gsdnld.\+html}} (The Mik\+Tex uses this) 
\item Remember to close and reopen Unity if you have it open to update environment variables. 
\item Rename Doxy\+PDF.\+txt to Doxy\+PDF.\+bat in Doxygen\textbackslash{}\+Editor\textbackslash{}\+Resources 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

One thing that I have found out the hard way is that if you have deep file hearcies some times makeindex refman.\+idx rejects files. This is a known bug {\texttt{ http\+://sourceforge.\+net/p/miktex/bugs/2144/}}

{\bfseries{To generate the PDF files\+:}} 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Fill in every thing in settings. 
\item Press \char`\"{}\+Save Settings(....\char`\"{} 
\item Go to \char`\"{}\+Generate/\+View/\+Edit\char`\"{} 
\item Remember to always use full paths to source in Doxygenwizard and they should have / not \textbackslash{} as fodler separator 
\item Press \char`\"{}\+Generate PDFs\char`\"{} 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Best of luck~\newline
