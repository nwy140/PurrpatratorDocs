.SS "override void Launcher_old\&.OnConnectedToMaster ()\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called when the client is connected to the Master Server and ready for matchmaking and other tasks\&. The list of available rooms won't become available unless you join a lobby via LoadBalancingClient\&.OpJoinLobby\&. You can join rooms and create them even without being in a lobby\&. The default lobby is used in that case\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks\fP\&.

.SS "override void Launcher_old\&.OnCreateRoomFailed (short returnCode, string message)\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called when the server couldn't create a room (OpCreateRoom failed)\&. The most common cause to fail creating a room, is when a title relies on fixed room-names and the room already exists\&. 
.PP

.SS "override void Launcher_old\&.OnJoinedLobby ()\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called on entering a lobby on the Master Server\&. The actual room-list updates will call OnRoomListUpdate\&. 
.PP
While in the lobby, the roomlist is automatically updated in fixed intervals (which you can't modify in the public cloud)\&. The room list gets available via OnRoomListUpdate\&.

Reimplemented from \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks\fP\&.

.SS "override void Launcher_old\&.OnJoinedRoom ()\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called when the LoadBalancingClient entered a room, no matter if this client created it or simply joined\&. When this is called, you can access the existing players in Room\&.Players, their custom properties and Room\&.CustomProperties\&.
.PP
In this callback, you could create player objects\&. For example in Unity, instantiate a prefab for the player\&.
.PP
If you want a match to be started 'actively', enable the user to signal 'ready' (using OpRaiseEvent or a Custom Property)\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks\fP\&.
.PP
Definition at line \fB64\fP of file \fBLauncher_Old\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "override void Launcher_old\&.OnLeftRoom ()\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called when the local user/client left a room, so the game's logic can clean up it's internal state\&. When leaving a room, the LoadBalancingClient will disconnect the Game Server and connect to the Master Server\&. This wraps up multiple internal actions\&.
.PP
Wait for the callback OnConnectedToMaster, before you use lobbies and join or create rooms\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks\fP\&.

Definition at line \fB108\fP of file \fBLauncher_Old\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "override void Launcher_old\&.OnMasterClientSwitched (\fBPlayer\fP newMasterClient)\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called after switching to a new MasterClient when the current one leaves\&. This is not called when this client enters a room\&. The former MasterClient is still in the player list when this method get called\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks\fP\&.

Definition at line \fB84\fP of file \fBLauncher_Old\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "override void Launcher_old\&.OnPlayerEnteredRoom (\fBPlayer\fP newPlayer)\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called when a remote player entered the room\&. This Player is already added to the playerlist\&. 
.PP
If your game starts with a certain number of players, this callback can be useful to check the Room\&.playerCount and find out if you can start\&.

.SS "override void Launcher_old\&.OnRoomListUpdate (List< \fBRoomInfo\fP > roomList)\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called for any update of the room-listing while in a lobby (InLobby) on the Master Server\&. Each item is a RoomInfo which might include custom properties (provided you defined those as lobby-listed when creating a room)\&. Not all types of lobbies provide a listing of rooms to the client\&. Some are silent and specialized for server-side matchmaking\&.
