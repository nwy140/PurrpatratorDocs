(32756) Authorization on the \fBPhoton\fP Cloud failed because the app's subscription does not allow to use a particular region's server\&. Some subscription plans for the \fBPhoton\fP Cloud are region-bound\&. Servers of other regions can't be used then\&.

OpAuthorize is part of connection workflow but only on the \fBPhoton\fP Cloud, this error can happen\&. Self-hosted \fBPhoton\fP servers with a CCU limited license won't let a client connect at all\&.

.PP
(32757) Authorization on the \fBPhoton\fP Cloud failed because the concurrent users (CCU) limit of the app's subscription is reached\&. Unless you have a plan with 'CCU Burst', clients might fail the authentication step during connect\&. Affected client are unable to call operations\&. Please note that players who end a game and return to the master server will disconnect and re-connect, which means that they just played and are rejected in the next minute / re-connect\&. This is a temporary measure\&. Once the CCU is below the limit, players will be able to connect an play again\&.
