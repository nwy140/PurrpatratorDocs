.PP
Called when the client is connected to the Master Server and ready for matchmaking and other tasks\&. The list of available rooms won't become available unless you join a lobby via \fBLoadBalancingClient\&.OpJoinLobby\fP\&. You can join rooms and create them even without being in a lobby\&. The default lobby is used in that case\&.

.PP
Called when the server couldn't create a room (OpCreateRoom failed)\&. The most common cause to fail creating a room, is when a title relies on fixed room-names and the room already exists\&.

.SS "override void Photon\&.Pun\&.Demo\&.Asteroids\&.LobbyMainPanel\&.OnJoinedLobby ()\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called on entering a lobby on the Master Server\&. The actual room-list updates will call OnRoomListUpdate\&. 
.PP
While in the lobby, the roomlist is automatically updated in fixed intervals (which you can't modify in the public cloud)\&. The room list gets available via OnRoomListUpdate\&.

.SS "override void Photon\&.Pun\&.Demo\&.Asteroids\&.LobbyMainPanel\&.OnJoinedRoom ()\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called when the LoadBalancingClient entered a room, no matter if this client created it or simply joined\&. When this is called, you can access the existing players in \fBRoom\&.Players\fP, their custom properties and \fBRoom\&.CustomProperties\fP\&.
.PP
In this callback, you could create player objects\&. For example in Unity, instantiate a prefab for the player\&.
.PP
If you want a match to be started 'actively', enable the user to signal 'ready' (using OpRaiseEvent or a Custom Property)\&.

.SS "override void Photon\&.Pun\&.Demo\&.Asteroids\&.LobbyMainPanel\&.OnJoinRandomFailed (short returnCode, string message)\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called when a previous OpJoinRandom call failed on the server\&. The most common causes are that a room is full or does not exist (due to someone else being faster or closing the room)\&.
.PP
When using multiple lobbies (via OpJoinLobby or a TypedLobby parameter), another lobby might have more/fitting rooms\&.

.SS "override void Photon\&.Pun\&.Demo\&.Asteroids\&.LobbyMainPanel\&.OnLeftLobby ()\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called after leaving a lobby\&. When you leave a lobby, \fBOpCreateRoom\fP and \fBOpJoinRandomRoom\fP automatically refer to the default lobby\&.

.SS "override void Photon\&.Pun\&.Demo\&.Asteroids\&.LobbyMainPanel\&.OnLeftRoom ()\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called when the local user/client left a room, so the game's logic can clean up it's internal state\&. When leaving a room, the LoadBalancingClient will disconnect the Game Server and connect to the Master Server\&. This wraps up multiple internal actions\&.
.PP
Wait for the callback OnConnectedToMaster, before you use lobbies and join or create rooms\&.

.PP
Called after switching to a new MasterClient when the current one leaves\&. This is not called when this client enters a room\&. The former MasterClient is still in the player list when this method get called\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks\fP\&.

.SS "override void Photon\&.Pun\&.Demo\&.Asteroids\&.LobbyMainPanel\&.OnPlayerEnteredRoom (\fBPlayer\fP newPlayer)\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called when a remote player entered the room\&. This Player is already added to the playerlist\&. 
.PP
If your game starts with a certain number of players, this callback can be useful to check the Room\&.playerCount and find out if you can start\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented from \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks\fP\&.
.PP
Definition at line \fB157\fP of file \fBLobbyMainPanel\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "override void Photon\&.Pun\&.Demo\&.Asteroids\&.LobbyMainPanel\&.OnPlayerLeftRoom (\fBPlayer\fP otherPlayer)\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called when a remote player left the room or became inactive\&. Check otherPlayer\&.IsInactive\&. 
.PP
If another player leaves the room or if the server detects a lost connection, this callback will be used to notify your game logic\&.
.PP
Depending on the room's setup, players may become inactive, which means they may return and retake their spot in the room\&. In such cases, the Player stays in the \fBRoom\&.Players\fP dictionary\&.
.PP
If the player is not just inactive, it gets removed from the \fBRoom\&.Players\fP dictionary, before the callback is called\&.

.PP
Called when custom player-properties are changed\&. Player and the changed properties are passed as object[]\&. 
.PP
Changing properties must be done by \fBPlayer\&.SetCustomProperties\fP, which causes this callback locally, too\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fItargetPlayer\fP Contains Player that changed\&.

.PP
Called for any update of the room-listing while in a lobby (InLobby) on the Master Server\&. Each item is a RoomInfo which might include custom properties (provided you defined those as lobby-listed when creating a room)\&. Not all types of lobbies provide a listing of rooms to the client\&. Some are silent and specialized for server-side matchmaking\&.
