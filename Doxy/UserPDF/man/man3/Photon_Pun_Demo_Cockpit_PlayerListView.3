.SS "override void Photon\&.Pun\&.Demo\&.Cockpit\&.PlayerListView\&.OnMasterClientSwitched (\fBPlayer\fP newMasterClient)\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called after switching to a new MasterClient when the current one leaves\&. This is not called when this client enters a room\&. The former MasterClient is still in the player list when this method get called\&.

.SS "override void Photon\&.Pun\&.Demo\&.Cockpit\&.PlayerListView\&.OnPlayerEnteredRoom (\fBPlayer\fP newPlayer)\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called when a remote player entered the room\&. This Player is already added to the playerlist\&. 
.PP
If your game starts with a certain number of players, this callback can be useful to check the Room\&.playerCount and find out if you can start\&.

.SS "override void Photon\&.Pun\&.Demo\&.Cockpit\&.PlayerListView\&.OnPlayerLeftRoom (\fBPlayer\fP otherPlayer)\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called when a remote player left the room or became inactive\&. Check otherPlayer\&.IsInactive\&. 
.PP
If another player leaves the room or if the server detects a lost connection, this callback will be used to notify your game logic\&.
.PP
Depending on the room's setup, players may become inactive, which means they may return and retake their spot in the room\&. In such cases, the Player stays in the \fBRoom\&.Players\fP dictionary\&.
.PP
If the player is not just inactive, it gets removed from the \fBRoom\&.Players\fP dictionary, before the callback is called\&.
