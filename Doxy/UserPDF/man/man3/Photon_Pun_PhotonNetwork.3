.SS "static bool Photon\&.Pun\&.PhotonNetwork\&.SetMasterClient (\fBPlayer\fP masterClientPlayer)\fC [static]\fP"

.PP
Asks the server to assign another player as Master Client of your current room\&. RPCs and RaiseEvent have the option to send messages only to the Master Client of a room\&. SetMasterClient affects which client gets those messages\&.
.PP
This method calls an operation on the server to set a new Master Client, which takes a roundtrip\&. In case of success, this client and the others get the new Master Client from the server\&.
.PP
SetMasterClient tells the server which current Master Client should be replaced with the new one\&. It will fail, if anything switches the Master Client moments earlier\&. There is no callback for this error\&. All clients should get the new Master Client assigned by the server anyways\&.
.PP
See also: \fBPhotonNetwork\&.MasterClient\fP
.PP
On v3 servers: The \fBReceiverGroup\&.MasterClient\fP (usable in RPCs) is not affected by this (still points to lowest player\&.ID in room)\&. Avoid using this enum value (and send to a specific player instead)\&.

If the current Master Client leaves, PUN will detect a new one by 'lowest player ID'\&. Implement OnMasterClientSwitched to get a callback in this case\&. The PUN-selected Master Client might assign a new one\&.

Make sure you don't create an endless loop of Master-assigning! When selecting a custom Master Client, all clients should point to the same player, no matter who actually assigns this player\&.

.PP
It's best practice to disconnect inactive apps/connections after a while but to also allow users to take calls, etc\&.\&. We think a reasonable background timeout is 60 seconds\&.
.PP
To handle the timeout, implement: OnDisconnected(), as usual\&. Your application will 'notice' the background disconnect when it becomes active again (running the Update() loop)\&.
.PP
If you need to separate this case from others, you need to track if the app was in the background (there is no special callback by PUN)\&.
.PP
Info: PUN is running a 'fallback thread' to send ACKs to the server, even when Unity is not calling Update() regularly\&. This helps keeping the connection while loading scenes and assets and when the app is in the background\&.
.PP
Note: Some platforms (e\&.g\&. iOS) don't allow to keep a connection while the app is in background\&. In those cases, this value does not change anything, the app immediately loses connection in background\&.

This client's Player instance is always available, unless the app shuts down\&. Useful (e\&.g\&.) to set the Custom Player Properties or the NickName for this client anytime\&. When the client joins a room, the Custom Properties and other values are synced\&.

.SS "\fBPlayer\fP Photon\&.Pun\&.PhotonNetwork\&.MasterClient\fC [static]\fP, \fC [get]\fP"

.PP
The Master Client of the current room or null (outside of rooms)\&. Can be used as 'authoritative' client/player to make descisions, run AI or other\&.
.PP
If the current Master Client leaves the room (leave/disconnect), the server will quickly assign someone else\&. If the current Master Client times out (closed app, lost connection, etc), messages sent to this client are effectively lost for the others! A timeout can take 10 seconds in which no Master Client is active\&.
.PP
Implement the method IPunCallbacks\&.OnMasterClientSwitched to be called when the Master Client switched\&.
.PP
Use \fBPhotonNetwork\&.SetMasterClient\fP, to switch manually to some other player / client\&.
.PP
With OfflineMode == true, this always returns the PhotonNetwork\&.player\&.

.PP
Defines the number of times a reliable message can be resent before not getting an ACK for it will trigger a disconnect\&. Default: 5\&.
.PP
Less resends mean quicker disconnects, while more can lead to much more lag without helping\&. Min: 3\&. Max: 10\&.

.SS "\fBClientState\fP? Photon\&.Pun\&.PhotonNetwork\&.NetworkClientState\fC [static]\fP, \fC [get]\fP"

.PP
Directly provides the network-level client state, unless in OfflineMode\&. In context of PUN, you should usually use IsConnected or IsConnectedAndReady\&.
.PP
This is the lower level connection state\&. Keep in mind that PUN uses more than one server, so the client may become Disconnected, even though it's just switching servers\&.
.PP
While OfflineMode is true, this is ClientState\&.Joined (after create/join) or ConnectedToMasterServer in all other cases\&.

.PP
Set to synchronize the player's nickname with everyone in the room(s) you enter\&. This sets PhotonNetwork\&.player\&.NickName\&. 
.PP
The NickName is just a nickname and does not have to be unique or backed up with some account\&.

 Set the value any time (e\&.g\&. before you connect) and it will be available to everyone you play with\&.

.SS "int Photon\&.Pun\&.PhotonNetwork\&.QuickResends\fC [static]\fP, \fC [get]\fP, \fC [set]\fP"

.PP
In case of network loss, reliable messages can be repeated quickly up to 3 times\&. When reliable messages get lost more than once, subsequent repeats are delayed a bit to allow the network to recover\&.
.br
 With this option, the repeats 2 and 3 can be sped up\&. This can help avoid timeouts but also it increases the speed in which gaps are closed\&.
.br
 When you set this, increase \fBPhotonNetwork\&.MaxResendsBeforeDisconnect\fP to 6 or 7\&.

.SS "int Photon\&.Pun\&.PhotonNetwork\&.SendRate\fC [static]\fP, \fC [get]\fP, \fC [set]\fP"

.PP
Defines how many times per second the \fBPhotonHandler\fP should send data, if any is queued\&. Default: 30\&. 
.PP
This value defines how often PUN will call the low level PhotonPeer to put queued outgoing messages into a datagram to be sent\&. This is implemented in the \fBPhotonHandler\fP component, which integrates PUN into the Unity game loop\&. The \fBPhotonHandler\&.MaxDatagrams\fP value defines how many datagrams can be sent in one iteration\&.
.PP
This value does not affect how often updates are written by PhotonViews\&. That is controlled by the SerializationRate\&. To avoid send-delays for \fBPhotonView\fP updates, PUN will also send data at the end of frames that wrote data in OnPhotonSerializeView, so sending may actually be more frequent than the SendRate\&.
.PP
Messages queued due to RPCs and RaiseEvent, will be sent with at least SendRate frequency\&. They are included, when OnPhotonSerialize wrote updates and triggers early sending\&.
.PP
Setting this value does not adjust the SerializationRate anymore (as of PUN 2\&.24)\&.
.PP
Sending less often will aggregate messages in datagrams, which avoids overhead on the network\&. It is also important to not push too many datagrams per frame\&. Three to five seem to be the sweet spot\&.
.PP
Keep your target platform in mind: mobile networks are usually slower\&. WiFi is slower with more variance and bursts of loss\&.
.PP
A low framerate (as in Update calls) will affect sending of messages\&. 
.PP

.SS "int Photon\&.Pun\&.PhotonNetwork\&.SerializationRate\fC [static]\fP, \fC [get]\fP, \fC [set]\fP"

.PP
Defines how many times per second OnPhotonSerialize should be called on PhotonViews for controlled objects\&. This value defines how often PUN will call OnPhotonSerialize on controlled network objects\&. This is implemented in the \fBPhotonHandler\fP component, which integrates PUN into the Unity game loop\&.
.PP
The updates written in OnPhotonSerialize will be queued temporarily and sent in the next LateUpdate, so a high SerializationRate also causes more sends\&. The idea is to keep the delay short during which written updates are queued\&.
.PP
Calling RPCs will not trigger a send\&.
.PP
A low framerate will affect how frequent updates are written and how 'on time' they are\&.
.PP
A lower rate takes up less performance but the receiving side needs to interpolate longer times between updates\&.

The current server's millisecond timestamp\&. This can be useful to sync actions and events on all clients in one room\&. The timestamp is based on the server's Environment\&.TickCount\&.
