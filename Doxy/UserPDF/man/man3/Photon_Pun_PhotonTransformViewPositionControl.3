.SS "void Photon\&.Pun\&.PhotonTransformViewPositionControl\&.SetSynchronizedValues (Vector3 speed, float turnSpeed)"

.PP
These values are synchronized to the remote objects if the interpolation mode or the extrapolation mode SynchronizeValues is used\&. Your movement script should pass on the current speed (in units/second) and turning speed (in angles/second) so the remote object can use them to predict the objects movement\&. 
.PP

\fIspeed\fP The current movement vector of the object in units/second\&.
