.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Container type for callbacks defined by \fBIConnectionCallbacks\fP\&. 

See LoadBalancingCallbackTargets\&. 
.PP
While the interfaces of callbacks wrap up the methods that will be called, the container classes implement a simple way to call a method on all registered objects\&.

.SS "void Photon\&.Realtime\&.ConnectionCallbacksContainer\&.OnConnected ()"

.PP
Called to signal that the 'low level connection' got established but before the client can call operation on the server\&. After the (low level transport) connection is established, the client will automatically send the Authentication operation, which needs to get a response before the client can call other operations\&.
.PP
Your logic should wait for either: OnRegionListReceived or OnConnectedToMaster\&.
.PP
This callback is useful to detect if the server can be reached at all (technically)\&. Most often, it's enough to implement \fBOnDisconnected(DisconnectCause cause)\fP and check for the cause\&.
.PP
This is not called for transitions from the masterserver to game servers\&. 
.PP
Implements \fBPhoton\&.Realtime\&.IConnectionCallbacks\fP\&.

.SS "void Photon\&.Realtime\&.ConnectionCallbacksContainer\&.OnConnectedToMaster ()"

.PP
Called when the client is connected to the Master Server and ready for matchmaking and other tasks\&. The list of available rooms won't become available unless you join a lobby via \fBLoadBalancingClient\&.OpJoinLobby\fP\&. You can join rooms and create them even without being in a lobby\&. The default lobby is used in that case\&. 
.PP
Implements \fBPhoton\&.Realtime\&.IConnectionCallbacks\fP\&.

Definition at line \fB4081\fP of file \fBLoadBalancingClient\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "void Photon\&.Realtime\&.ConnectionCallbacksContainer\&.OnCustomAuthenticationFailed (string debugMessage)"

.PP
Called when the custom authentication failed\&. Followed by disconnect! 
.PP
Custom Authentication can fail due to user-input, bad tokens/secrets\&. If authentication is successful, this method is not called\&. Implement OnJoinedLobby() or \fBOnConnectedToMaster()\fP (as usual)\&.
.PP
During development of a game, it might also fail due to wrong configuration on the server side\&. In those cases, logging the debugMessage is very important\&.
.PP
Unless you setup a custom authentication service for your app (in the \fCDashboard\fP), this won't be called! 
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIdebugMessage\fP Contains a debug message why authentication failed\&. This has to be fixed during development\&.

.SS "void Photon\&.Realtime\&.ConnectionCallbacksContainer\&.OnCustomAuthenticationResponse (Dictionary< string, object > data)"

.PP
Called when your Custom Authentication service responds with additional data\&. Custom Authentication services can include some custom data in their response\&. When present, that data is made available in this callback as Dictionary\&. While the keys of your data have to be strings, the values can be either string or a number (in Json)\&. You need to make extra sure, that the value type is the one you expect\&. Numbers become (currently) int64\&.
.PP
Example: void OnCustomAuthenticationResponse(Dictionary<string, object> data) { \&.\&.\&. }

.SS "void Photon\&.Realtime\&.ConnectionCallbacksContainer\&.OnDisconnected (\fBDisconnectCause\fP cause)"

.PP
Called after disconnecting from the \fBPhoton\fP server\&. It could be a failure or an explicit disconnect call 
.PP
The reason for this disconnect is provided as DisconnectCause\&.
