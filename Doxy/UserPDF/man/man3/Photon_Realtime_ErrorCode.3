(32757) Authorization on the \fBPhoton\fP Cloud failed becaus the concurrent users (CCU) limit of the app's subscription is reached\&. Unless you have a plan with 'CCU Burst', clients might fail the authentication step during connect\&. Affected client are unable to call operations\&. Please note that players who end a game and return to the master server will disconnect and re-connect, which means that they just played and are rejected in the next minute / re-connect\&. This is a temporary measure\&. Once the CCU is below the limit, players will be able to connect an play again\&.

This error may happen for all operations that create rooms\&. The operation response will contain this error code\&.

This error is very unlikely to happen as we monitor load on all servers and add them on demand\&. However, it's good to be prepared for a shortage of machines or surge in CCUs\&.
