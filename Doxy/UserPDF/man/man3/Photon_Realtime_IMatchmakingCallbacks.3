.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Collection of 'organizational' callbacks for the \fBRealtime\fP Api to cover Matchmaking\&. 

Classes that implement this interface must be registered to get callbacks for various situations\&.
.PP
To register for callbacks, call \fBLoadBalancingClient\&.AddCallbackTarget\fP and pass the class implementing this interface To stop getting callbacks, call \fBLoadBalancingClient\&.RemoveCallbackTarget\fP and pass the class implementing this interface
.PP
Definition at line \fB3743\fP of file \fBLoadBalancingClient\&.cs\fP\&.

.PP 
.SS "void Photon\&.Realtime\&.IMatchmakingCallbacks\&.OnCreatedRoom ()"

.PP
Called when this client created a room and entered it\&. \fBOnJoinedRoom()\fP will be called as well\&. 
.PP
This callback is only called on the client which created a room (see OpCreateRoom)\&.
.PP
As any client might close (or drop connection) anytime, there is a chance that the creator of a room does not execute OnCreatedRoom\&.
.PP
If you need specific room properties or a 'start signal', implement OnMasterClientSwitched() and make each new MasterClient check the room's state\&. 
.PP
Implemented in \fBPhoton\&.Realtime\&.MatchMakingCallbacksContainer\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Realtime\&.SupportLogger\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Realtime\&.Demo\&.ConnectAndJoinRandomLb\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.PhotonHandler\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.UtilityScripts\&.OnJoinedInstantiate\fP, and \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.Simple\&.NetObject\fP\&.
.SS "void Photon\&.Realtime\&.IMatchmakingCallbacks\&.OnCreateRoomFailed (short returnCode, string message)"

.PP
Called when the server couldn't create a room (OpCreateRoom failed)\&. Creating a room may fail for various reasons\&. Most often, the room already exists (roomname in use) or the \fBRoomOptions\fP clash and it's impossible to create the room\&.
.PP
When creating a room fails on a Game Server: The client will cache the failure internally and returns to the Master Server before it calls the fail-callback\&. This way, the client is ready to find/create a room at the moment of the callback\&. In this case, the client skips calling OnConnectedToMaster but returning to the Master Server will still call OnConnected\&. Treat callbacks of OnConnected as pure information that the client could connect\&.

.SS "void Photon\&.Realtime\&.IMatchmakingCallbacks\&.OnFriendListUpdate (List< \fBFriendInfo\fP > friendList)"

.PP
Called when the server sent the response to a FindFriends request\&. After calling OpFindFriends, the Master Server will cache the friend list and send updates to the friend list\&. The friends includes the name, userId, online state and the room (if any) for each requested user/friend\&.
.PP
Use the friendList to update your UI and store it, if the UI should highlight changes\&. 
.PP
Implemented in \fBPhoton\&.Realtime\&.MatchMakingCallbacksContainer\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Realtime\&.SupportLogger\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Realtime\&.Demo\&.ConnectAndJoinRandomLb\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.Demo\&.Cockpit\&.FriendListView\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.UtilityScripts\&.OnJoinedInstantiate\fP, and \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.Simple\&.NetObject\fP\&.
.SS "void Photon\&.Realtime\&.IMatchmakingCallbacks\&.OnJoinedRoom ()"

.PP
Called when the \fBLoadBalancingClient\fP entered a room, no matter if this client created it or simply joined\&. When this is called, you can access the existing players in \fBRoom\&.Players\fP, their custom properties and \fBRoom\&.CustomProperties\fP\&.
.PP
In this callback, you could create player objects\&. For example in Unity, instantiate a prefab for the player\&.
.PP
If you want a match to be started 'actively', enable the user to signal 'ready' (using OpRaiseEvent or a Custom Property)\&.

.SS "void Photon\&.Realtime\&.IMatchmakingCallbacks\&.OnJoinRandomFailed (short returnCode, string message)"

.PP
Called when a previous OpJoinRandom call failed on the server\&. The most common causes are that a room is full or does not exist (due to someone else being faster or closing the room)\&.
.PP
This operation is only ever sent to the Master Server\&. Once a room is found by the Master Server, the client will head off to the designated Game Server and use the operation Join on the Game Server\&.
.PP
When using multiple lobbies (via OpJoinLobby or a \fBTypedLobby\fP parameter), another lobby might have more/fitting rooms\&.

.SS "void Photon\&.Realtime\&.IMatchmakingCallbacks\&.OnJoinRoomFailed (short returnCode, string message)"

.PP
Called when a previous OpJoinRoom call failed on the server\&. Joining a room may fail for various reasons\&. Most often, the room is full or does not exist anymore (due to someone else being faster or closing the room)\&.
.PP
When joining a room fails on a Game Server: The client will cache the failure internally and returns to the Master Server before it calls the fail-callback\&. This way, the client is ready to find/create a room at the moment of the callback\&. In this case, the client skips calling OnConnectedToMaster but returning to the Master Server will still call OnConnected\&.

.PP
Called when the local user/client left a room, so the game's logic can clean up it's internal state\&. When leaving a room, the \fBLoadBalancingClient\fP will disconnect the Game Server and connect to the Master Server\&. This wraps up multiple internal actions\&.

Wait for the callback OnConnectedToMaster, before you use lobbies and join or create rooms\&.
