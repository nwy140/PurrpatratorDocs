.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Wraps up common room properties needed when you create rooms\&. 

Read the individual entries for more details\&.
.PP
This directly maps to the fields in the \fBRoom\fP class\&.

.SH "Member Data Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "\fBHashtable\fP Photon\&.Realtime\&.RoomOptions\&.CustomRoomProperties"

.PP
The room's custom properties to set\&. Use string keys!
.PP
Custom room properties are any key-values you need to define the game's setup\&. The shorter your keys are, the better\&. Example: Map, Mode (could be 'm' when used with 'Map'), TileSet (could be 't')\&. 
.PP
Definition at line \fB1852\fP of file \fBLoadbalancingPeer\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "string [] Photon\&.Realtime\&.RoomOptions\&.CustomRoomPropertiesForLobby = new string[0]"

.PP
Defines the custom room properties that get listed in the lobby\&. Name the custom room properties that should be available to clients that are in a lobby\&. Use with care\&. Unless a custom property is essential for matchmaking or user info, it should not be sent to the lobby, which causes traffic and delays for clients in the lobby\&.
.PP
Default: No custom properties are sent to the lobby\&. 
.PP
Definition at line \fB1862\fP of file \fBLoadbalancingPeer\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "int Photon\&.Realtime\&.RoomOptions\&.EmptyRoomTtl"

.PP
Time To Live (TTL) for a room when the last player leaves\&. Keeps room in memory for case a player re-joins soon\&. In milliseconds\&.
.PP
Definition at line \fB1835\fP of file \fBLoadbalancingPeer\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "byte Photon\&.Realtime\&.RoomOptions\&.MaxPlayers"

.PP
Max number of players that can be in the room at any time\&. 0 means 'no limit'\&.
.PP
Definition at line \fB1829\fP of file \fBLoadbalancingPeer\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "int Photon\&.Realtime\&.RoomOptions\&.PlayerTtl"

.PP
Time To Live (TTL) for an 'actor' in a room\&. If a client disconnects, this actor is inactive first and removed after this timeout\&. In milliseconds\&.
.PP
Definition at line \fB1832\fP of file \fBLoadbalancingPeer\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "string [] Photon\&.Realtime\&.RoomOptions\&.Plugins"

.PP
Informs the server of the expected plugin setup\&. The operation will fail in case of a plugin missmatch returning error code PluginMismatch 32757(0x7FFF - 10)\&. Setting string[]{} means the client expects no plugin to be setup\&. Note: for backwards compatibility null omits any check\&. 
.PP

.SH "Property Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "bool Photon\&.Realtime\&.RoomOptions\&.BroadcastPropsChangeToAll\fC [get]\fP, \fC [set]\fP"

.PP
By default, property changes are sent back to the client that's setting them to avoid de-sync when properties are set concurrently\&. This option is enables by default to fix this scenario:
.PP
1) On server, room property ABC is set to value FOO, which triggers notifications to all the clients telling them that the property changed\&. 2) While that notification is in flight, a client sets the ABC property to value BAR\&. 3) Client receives notification from the server and changes itï¿½s local copy of ABC to FOO\&. 4) Server receives the set operation and changes the official value of ABC to BAR, but never notifies the client that sent the set operation that the value is now BAR\&.
.PP
Without this option, the client that set the value to BAR never hears from the server that the official copy has been updated to BAR, and thus gets stuck with a value of FOO\&. 
.PP
Definition at line \fB1916\fP of file \fBLoadbalancingPeer\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "bool Photon\&.Realtime\&.RoomOptions\&.CleanupCacheOnLeave\fC [get]\fP, \fC [set]\fP"

.PP
Removes a user's events and properties from the room when a user leaves\&. This makes sense when in rooms where players can't place items in the room and just vanish entirely\&. When you disable this, the event history can become too long to load if the room stays in use indefinitely\&. Default: true\&. Cleans up the cache and props of leaving users\&. 
.PP
Definition at line \fB1843\fP of file \fBLoadbalancingPeer\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "bool Photon\&.Realtime\&.RoomOptions\&.DeleteNullProperties\fC [get]\fP, \fC [set]\fP"

.PP
Optionally, properties get deleted, when null gets assigned as value\&. Defaults to off / false\&.
.PP
When Op SetProperties is setting a key's value to null, the server and clients should remove the key/value from the Custom Properties\&. By default, the server keeps the keys (and null values) and sends them to joining players\&.
.PP
Important: Only when SetProperties does a 'broadcast', the change (key, value = null) is sent to clients to update accordingly\&. This applies to Custom Properties for rooms and actors/players\&. 
.PP
Definition at line \fB1903\fP of file \fBLoadbalancingPeer\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "bool Photon\&.Realtime\&.RoomOptions\&.IsOpen\fC [get]\fP, \fC [set]\fP"

.PP
Defines if this room can be joined at all\&. If a room is closed, no player can join this\&. As example this makes sense when 3 of 4 possible players start their gameplay early and don't want anyone to join during the game\&. The room can still be listed in the lobby (set isVisible to control lobby-visibility)\&. 
.PP
Definition at line \fB1825\fP of file \fBLoadbalancingPeer\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "bool Photon\&.Realtime\&.RoomOptions\&.IsVisible\fC [get]\fP, \fC [set]\fP"

.PP
Defines if this room is listed in the lobby\&. If not, it also is not joined randomly\&.
.PP
A room that is not visible will be excluded from the room lists that are sent to the clients in lobbies\&. An invisible room can be joined by name but is excluded from random matchmaking\&.
.PP
Use this to 'hide' a room and simulate 'private rooms'\&. Players can exchange a roomname and create it invisble to avoid anyone else joining it\&. 
.PP
Definition at line \fB1816\fP of file \fBLoadbalancingPeer\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "bool Photon\&.Realtime\&.RoomOptions\&.PublishUserId\fC [get]\fP, \fC [set]\fP"

.PP
Defines if the UserIds of players get 'published' in the room\&. Useful for FindFriends, if players want to play another game together\&. 
.PP
When you set this to true, \fBPhoton\fP will publish the UserIds of the players in that room\&. In that case, you can use PhotonPlayer\&.userId, to access any player's userID\&. This is useful for FindFriends and to set 'expected users' to reserve slots in a room\&. 
.PP
Definition at line \fB1893\fP of file \fBLoadbalancingPeer\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "bool Photon\&.Realtime\&.RoomOptions\&.SuppressPlayerInfo\fC [get]\fP, \fC [set]\fP"

.PP
Disables events join and leave from the server as well as property broadcasts in a room (to minimize traffic)
.PP
Definition at line \fB1883\fP of file \fBLoadbalancingPeer\&.cs\fP\&.
.SS "bool Photon\&.Realtime\&.RoomOptions\&.SuppressRoomEvents\fC [get]\fP, \fC [set]\fP"

.PP
Tells the server to skip room events for joining and leaving players\&. Using this makes the client unaware of the other players in a room\&. That can save some traffic if you have some server logic that updates players but it can also limit the client's usability\&. 
.PP
Definition at line \fB1880\fP of file \fBLoadbalancingPeer\&.cs\fP\&.
