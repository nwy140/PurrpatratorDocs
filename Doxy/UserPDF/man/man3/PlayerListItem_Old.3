.SS "override void PlayerListItem_Old\&.OnLeftRoom ()\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called when the local user/client left a room, so the game's logic can clean up it's internal state\&. When leaving a room, the LoadBalancingClient will disconnect the Game Server and connect to the Master Server\&. This wraps up multiple internal actions\&.
.PP
Wait for the callback OnConnectedToMaster, before you use lobbies and join or create rooms\&.

.SS "override void PlayerListItem_Old\&.OnPlayerLeftRoom (\fBPlayer\fP otherPlayer)\fC [virtual]\fP"

.PP
Called when a remote player left the room or became inactive\&. Check otherPlayer\&.IsInactive\&. 
.PP
If another player leaves the room or if the server detects a lost connection, this callback will be used to notify your game logic\&.
.PP
Depending on the room's setup, players may become inactive, which means they may return and retake their spot in the room\&. In such cases, the Player stays in the Room\&.Players dictionary\&.
.PP
If the player is not just inactive, it gets removed from the Room\&.Players dictionary, before the callback is called\&.
