.TP
\fB\fIDisconnecting \fP\fP
The client disconnects (from any server)\&. This leads to state Disconnected\&.

\fB\fIDisconnected \fP\fP
The client is no longer connected (to any server)\&. Connect to MasterServer to go on\&.
.TP
\fB\fIConnectedToMasterServer \fP\fP
Connected to MasterServer\&. You might use matchmaking or join a lobby now\&.
.TP
\fB\fIConnectedToMasterserver \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIConnectedToMaster \fP\fP
.TP
\fB\fIConnectingToNameServer \fP\fP
Client connects to the NameServer\&. This process includes low level connecting and setting up encryption\&. When done, state becomes ConnectedToNameServer\&.
.TP
\fB\fIConnectedToNameServer \fP\fP
Client is connected to the NameServer and established encryption already\&. You should call OpGetRegions or ConnectToRegionMaster\&.
.TP
\fB\fIDisconnectingFromNameServer \fP\fP
Clients disconnects (specifically) from the NameServer (usually to connect to the MasterServer)\&.
.TP
\fB\fIConnectWithFallbackProtocol \fP\fP
Client was unable to connect to Name Server and will attempt to connect with an alternative network protocol (TCP)\&.

.SS "enum \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.PunLogLevel\fP"

\fB\fIErrorsOnly \fP\fP
Show only errors\&. Minimal output\&. Note: Some might be 'runtime errors' which you have to expect\&.
.TP
\fB\fIInformational \fP\fP
Logs some of the workflow, calls and results\&.
.TP
\fB\fIFull \fP\fP
Every available log call gets into the console/log\&. Only use for debugging\&.

.PP
\fBEnumerator\fP
.in +1c
.TP
\fB\fIAll \fP\fP
Sends the RPC to everyone else and executes it immediately on this client\&. Player who join later will not execute this RPC\&.
.TP
\fB\fIOthers \fP\fP
Sends the RPC to everyone else\&. This client does not execute the RPC\&. Player who join later will not execute this RPC\&.
.TP
\fB\fIMasterClient \fP\fP
Sends the RPC to MasterClient only\&. Careful: The MasterClient might disconnect before it executes the RPC and that might cause dropped RPCs\&.
.TP
\fB\fIAllBuffered \fP\fP

.TP

.TP
\fB\fIAllViaServer \fP\fP
Sends the RPC to everyone (including this client) through the server\&. This client executes the RPC like any other when it received it from the server\&. Benefit: The server's order of sending the RPCs is the same on all clients\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIAllBufferedViaServer \fP\fP
Sends the RPC to everyone (including this client) through the server and buffers it for players joining later\&. This client executes the RPC like any other when it received it from the server\&. Benefit: The server's order of sending the RPCs is the same on all clients\&.

.SH "Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "void Photon\&.Pun\&.IPunObservable\&.OnPhotonSerializeView (\fBPhotonStream\fP stream, \fBPhotonMessageInfo\fP info)"

.PP
Called by PUN several times per second, so that your script can write and read synchronization data for the \fBPhotonView\fP\&. This method will be called in scripts that are assigned as Observed component of a \fBPhotonView\fP\&.
.br
 \fBPhotonNetwork\&.SerializationRate\fP affects how often this method is called\&.
.br
 \fBPhotonNetwork\&.SendRate\fP affects how often packages are sent by this client\&.
.br
.PP
Implementing this method, you can customize which data a \fBPhotonView\fP regularly synchronizes\&. Your code defines what is being sent (content) and how your data is used by receiving clients\&.
.PP
Unlike other callbacks, \fIOnPhotonSerializeView only gets called when it is assigned to a \fBPhotonView\fP\fP as PhotonView\&.observed script\&.
.PP
To make use of this method, the \fBPhotonStream\fP is essential\&. It will be in 'writing' mode' on the
client that controls a PhotonView (PhotonStream\&.IsWriting == true) and in 'reading mode' on the
remote clients that just receive that the controlling client sends\&.

If you skip writing any value into the stream, PUN will skip the update\&. Used carefully, this can
conserve bandwidth and messages (which have a limit per room/second)\&.

Note that OnPhotonSerializeView is not called on remote clients when the sender does not send
any update\&. This can't be used as 'x-times per second Update()"\&. 
.PP
Implemented in \fBTimerScript\fP, \fBBreakableFurniture\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.PhotonAnimatorView\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.PhotonRigidbody2DView\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.PhotonRigidbodyView\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.PhotonTransformView\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.PhotonTransformViewClassic\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.Demo\&.PunBasics\&.PlayerManager\fP, \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.UtilityScripts\&.CullingHandler\fP, and \fBPhoton\&.Pun\&.UtilityScripts\&.SmoothSyncMovement\fP\&.
